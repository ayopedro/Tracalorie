This is a web project that tracks the Calorie in foods and stores them
in the local storage.
it sums up all the calories and I employed majorly javascript patterns from my learning.

this project was created using pure vanilla javascript with no frameworks or library.

The UI was created using Materialize UI and its dependencies.
